The only reason why you might want to extend the nltk trees or implement your
own is the idea that you need to have trees where some of the nodes are in a
current state.

However, we can just keep a separate mapping from paths to nodes (which are
themselves trees usually; they could also be terminals) and the states that
they're in.

So the function that applies a rule will take a tree and a rule and a
mapping from positions (tree paths) to states, and it will produce a new
tree and a new statemap.
