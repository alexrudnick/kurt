This is KURT, the Keen Utility for Rewriting Trees.

Implemented by Alex Rudnick (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~alexr) as part of a phd
qualifiers project.

KURT is a Python 3 library for experimenting with xT tree transducers, which
take in trees and produce other trees; they're described more fully in the
lovely article by Graehl et al [0].

KURT uses some code from NLTK (http://nltk.org), but just the minimally
required parts to make Tree objects work; these parts have been ported from
Python 2.

For usage examples, please see src/spanish.py, german.py, and pokemon.py !

To understand what this is all about, please see the associated quals article,
(which I will post very soon, 21 March 2012).
